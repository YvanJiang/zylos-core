  C4 communication bridge — central gateway for ALL external communication (Telegram, Lark, etc.).
  Use when replying to users via the "reply via" path, sending proactive messages to external channels,
  querying recent conversations or checkpoint status (prefer c4-db.js CLI; sqlite3 OK for unsupported queries),
  fetching conversation history for Memory Sync, or creating checkpoints after sync.
  Incoming messages are durably accepted and executed by the Core executor service.

# Communication Bridge (C4)

Central message hub - all communication is persisted and owned by Core.

## Architecture

```
Channels ──► Core ingress/queue ──► executor service ──► provider adapter
```

## Components

| Script | Purpose | Reference |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| `c4-receive.js` | Compatible text/event ingress into Core | [c4-receive](references/c4-receive.md) |
| `c4-send.js` | Claude → External (route outgoing messages) | [c4-send](references/c4-send.md) |
| `c4-control.js` | System control plane (heartbeat, maintenance) | [c4-control](references/c4-control.md) |
| `c4-fetch.js` | Fetch conversations by id range | [c4-fetch](references/c4-fetch.md) |
| `c4-db.js` | Database module and CLI for querying conversations and checkpoints | [c4-db](references/c4-db.md) |
| `c4-checkpoint.js` | Create/query checkpoints (sync boundaries) | [c4-checkpoint](references/c4-checkpoint.md) |

## Sending Messages

```bash
# Send to Telegram DM
cat <<'EOF' | node ~/zylos/.claude/skills/comm-bridge/scripts/c4-send.js telegram 8101553026
Hello! Quotes, $vars, **markdown** — all safe via stdin.
EOF

# Send to Lark group thread
cat <<'EOF' | node ~/zylos/.claude/skills/comm-bridge/scripts/c4-send.js lark "chat_xxx|type:group|root:msg_yyy"
Report ready.
EOF
```

Always pipe messages via stdin heredoc — never pass as CLI arguments. See [c4-send](references/c4-send.md) for full reference.
Treat the heredoc wrapper as fixed shell syntax: only the message body goes between the start line and the closing terminator line, and the terminator itself must never be copied into the actual outgoing message.

## Database

SQLite at `~/zylos/comm-bridge/c4.db`:
- `conversations`: All messages (in/out) with priority, status, retry tracking
- `checkpoints`: Recovery points with conversation id ranges
- `control_queue`: System control messages (heartbeat, maintenance) with priority, ack deadlines, and status lifecycle

## Health & Service Management

```bash
zylos status
zylos doctor --check
```

Core's executor identity and observability snapshot are authoritative. Do not
infer health from a provider session or deliver control through terminal input.
