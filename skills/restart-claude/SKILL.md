# Restart Claude Code Skill

Restart the long-lived Core executor service through the authoritative Zylos
service lifecycle. The executor owns the Claude provider prerequisite and
re-establishes it as part of its healthy service generation.

## When to Use

- After changing Claude Code settings, hooks, or keybindings
- When Claude needs to reload configuration
- To clear temporary state without upgrading
- User explicitly asks to restart

## Pre-Restart Checklist

Before restarting the executor, complete these steps **in order**:

### 1. Stop background tasks

Check for running background agents (Task tool). If any are active, stop them to avoid orphaned work.

### 2. Sync memory

Update memory files (state.md, sessions/current.md, etc.) to preserve important context that would otherwise be lost on restart.

### 3. Write a session handoff summary

Write a brief message covering:
- **What was being worked on** (active tasks, user requests in progress)
- **Current state** (what's done, what's pending, any blockers)
- **What the next session should pick up** (if anything)

### 4. Send the handoff summary

Send the full handoff summary to the internal `void` channel via C4:

```bash
cat <<'EOF' | node ~/zylos/.claude/skills/comm-bridge/scripts/c4-send.js "void" "session-handoff"
<handoff summary>
EOF
```

The `void` channel is record-only: the message is stored in C4 conversation
history (so the restarted session's startup hook, `c4-session-init`, includes
it in startup context) but is never delivered to any real channel or display
surface.

Do not send the full handoff summary to the active external user channel
(Telegram, Lark, Feishu, HXA, etc.). Handoff summaries are operational context
for the next agent session and may contain task state from outside the current
conversation. If the user is actively waiting, send only a short user-facing
notice to their current `reply via` path, without internal task inventory or
cross-channel context.

### 5. Restart through Core service control

```bash
zylos restart
zylos status
```

Treat a non-zero exit from either command as a failed restart. Do not invoke
PM2 directly: the CLI verifies the exact executor registration, performs the
durable shutdown handshake, and accepts only a new healthy Core service
identity.

## How It Works

1. **Durable shutdown**: Core fences new work and closes provider ownership.
2. **Exact supervisor control**: Zylos restarts only its owned executor registration.
3. **Generation proof**: Success requires a different healthy executor service identity.
